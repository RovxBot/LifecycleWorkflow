# Directory Structure

This repository implements a modular, parameterized configuration-as-code approach for Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Management. Each workflow (onboarding, offboarding, access management, privileged access) is self-contained and references shared parameters and templates.

Refer to the root README for a visual overview and directory tree.
